Frequently asked questions regarding library management, updates, categories, and cover art.

## Why is Global Update skipping entries?

Background updates can skip entries based on configured Smart Update restrictions (**More → Settings → Library → Global update → Smart update**):

- Has unwatched episodes (`Skip entries with unwatched episodes`).
- Has not been started yet (`Skip entries that haven't been started`).
- Marked with a **Completed** status (`Skip completed series`).
- Outside expected release schedule (`Skip entries outside release period`).

This reduces unnecessary server requests and prevents rate-limiting by extension sources.

> [!TIP]
> Categories included in global updates can be configured under **More → Settings → Library → Global update → Categories**.

## Why are background library updates not running?

Android device skins (such as MIUI, ColorOS, or OneUI) apply aggressive background process optimization that terminates background tasks.

To configure background execution:

1. Go to **More → Settings → Advanced**.
2. Select **Disable battery optimization**.
3. Allow AniZen to run unrestricted in system settings.
