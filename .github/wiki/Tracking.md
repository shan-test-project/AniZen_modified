## Auto-Tracking Configuration

When a series is bound, episode progress updates automatically upon reaching the configured threshold.

Settings path: **More → Settings → Tracking**

- **Update tracking when watching**: Toggles automatic progress dispatching when reaching the trigger threshold.
- **Trigger threshold**: Minimum percentage of episode duration watched (default: **85%**) before sending progress updates.

## Multi-Service Sync & Status Mapping

AniZen supports binding a title to multiple services concurrently (e.g., AniList and Trakt):

- **Status Mapping**: Watch status (*Watching*, *Completed*, *On Hold*, *Dropped*, *Plan to Watch*) synchronizes across all bound accounts.
- **Score Synchronization**: Ratings map to each platform's scoring system (10-point decimal for MAL/AniList, 5-star, or 100-point scales).
- **Media Format Tracking**: Services such as **Trakt**, **TMDB**, **Simkl**, and **Jellyfin** track both episodic series and standalone movie/OVA entries.
